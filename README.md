# Welcome to Michael Fogel's WorkOS Technical Interview Repo. 

In this Github repo, you will find my implementation of an example application demonstrating use of the [WorkOS Node SDK](https://github.com/workos-inc/workos-node) for SSO. Once you follow the steps to login with SSO, you will see a welcome screen with the first and last name used to sign in as well as the organization ID and the [organization name](https://workos.com/docs/reference/organization/get). 

I have cleared up the original example application folder and removed everything except for the node-sso-example folder, the .gitignore, .eslintrc.json, package-lock.json, and package.json files in order to make things more streamlined. 

## Technical Challenge implementing SSO from Example App

Simply navigate to the [`node-sso-example`](https://github.com/mikefogelj/WorkOS-SSO-Example/tree/my-sso-work/node-sso-example) folder for the more detailed README and information on my implementation of that challenge. Video demonstrations are also included in the other README. 

Have a great day, I hope you enjoy my responses!
